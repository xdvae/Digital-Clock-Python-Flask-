Hello everyone, this is my little project and im here to tell you how u can run this on your pc.

STEPS - 
1. Install python.
2. Install Flask in python (use : "pip install flask" in python terminal).
3. Install Request library from pip (use : "pip install requests" in python terminal).
3. Install Pytz library from pip (use : "pip install pytz" in python terminal).

Clone/Download the files: 

  CSS/JS file should be in the "static" folder.
  HTML file should be in the "templates" folder.

Run the python code "DigitalClock.py" and in terminal ctrl + click the "Running on http://192.168.1.7:5000".
That should open it in the browser.
